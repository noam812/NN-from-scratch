NN-from-scratch
This project implements neural networks from scratch, providing a deep dive into the fundamentals of neural network architecture and training.
Overview
NN-from-scratch is an educational project aimed at understanding the inner workings of neural networks by implementing them without relying on high-level machine learning libraries. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of:

Feedforward and backpropagation algorithms
Activation functions
Loss functions
Optimization techniques
